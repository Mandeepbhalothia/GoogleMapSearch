1. Please enable gps. Gps is not checked. Location Permission is asked.
2. Places Api is not there because it requires billing account, I don't have account. But
I tried multiple time 2 times it gives response and it search the places. You can replace key by yours for testing.
Hope it will work.
3. A fake location is added for testing Room.
4. When saved icon(top right corner below search bar) is pressed for fetching all saved places.
Click on any place it will add maker at specific place.
